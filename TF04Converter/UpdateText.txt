If you're updating from version 0.6.x.x to version 0.7.1.x or above, the auto-updater will not give you all the files you need. Download the most recent ZIP from https://TrevorHProgramming.github.io

Update 0.7.1.2: Changed the mod section to work dynamically. Mod support can now be added without additional patches to the Randomizer program. This requires and update for SELF, so the most recent ZIP will again be required.
Update 0.7.1.0: Added mod support for the Randomizer. This requires another external program, SELF.exe. If you don't have the most recent version of SELF, you'll need to get the most recent ZIP.
Update 0.7.0.3: Added a loading bar when 7zip is extracting game files. The Randomizer will no longer attempt to load if the Converter is processing files. Cancelling the selection of ImgBurn or 7z no longer changes the setting to an invalid path.
Update 0.7.0.2: Added autobuild support for non-US versions of the game. If you still experience issues with this, please let me know. 
Update 0.7.0.1: Hotfix for Randomizer release to remove excess debugging log messages.
